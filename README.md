Quick WP Login to View
===================

Just a quick implementation of a protected page, where you the visitor needs to log-in with sufficient capabilities to view.

== To Use This Plugin ==

1. Add the plugin to your plugins folder and activate
1. Copy the commented code in tpl-protected.php to your template files, or copy this file to your theme folder and select "Protected Page" as your page template.
1. Create a new user and assign the role of "Client Login"

To change the name of the user role, capability, add the capability to any other user, or add any other customizations you can edit the plugin file.  I didn't create any options for this, or else it wouldn't have been quick and I couldn't have called it Quick WP Login to View.
